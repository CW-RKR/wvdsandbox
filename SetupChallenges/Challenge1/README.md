# Challenge 1: Do AAD Sync using AD Connect  

[back](../README.md)  
  
In this challenge you'll **implement hybrid identity by sync'ing your AD users to your Azure AD** (AAD).  
So the final result of this exercise should look like:  
![synced accounts from AD in your AAD](AAD-SyncedUsers.PNG)  

## 0. Choose the AAD you want to sync to (i.e. _destination_)  
**Important**:
1. You should **not sync** to your production **AAD**! (_at least if your are not sure what you are doing ;-)_)  
2. You **need to be** | know the **_Global administrator_** of your **AAD**!  

**Why?, Because:...**  
- ...your AAD may already be sync'ed with another domain.
- ...you need the rights to give consent to the WVD applications (e.g. to make auth work for WVD user.)  
  
Take a look at the current sync status of your AAD:  
```
[Azure Portal] -> Azure Active Directory
``` 
| <H3>Looks like this?</H3> | <H3>or like that?</H3> |

| ![The right AAD -Yes](TheRightAAD-Yes.PNG)  | ![The right AAD - No](TheRightAAD-No.PNG)  |
| **Good to go!** | **This AAD is sync'ing already**. You'll probably want to **create a new AAD** for the WVD sandbox. Go [here](Subchallenge/CreateANewAAD.md) for the instructions. |


## 1. Download and Install the AD Connect Tool.
Log on to your domain controller (_wvdsdbox-AD-VM1_) via the jumphost (_wvdsdbox-FS-VM1_):
```
Internet ---RDP---> wvdsdbox-FS-VM1 (Public IP) ---RDP---> DC ('10.0.0.4')
```  
On the DC you will find the AD Connect tool already downloaded: _"C:\temp\AzureADConnect.msi"_  
**Doubleclick to install AD Connect.**

| On the DC install AD Connect | Hit **continue**  | **Use express settings** to speed things up.  |  

> **Note**: It is **not recommended** to install AD Connect on a domain controller.

## 2. Implement AD Connect
Now - please follow the picture story and **create a new AAD**:

| Logon **to Azure as global administrator** | Next: Specify your _onpremise_ **Domain Admin Credentials**  | To make our .local domain syncronize with AAD we need to **select the checkbox** - and hit **next**.<br>**Why?** _.local_ domains are not public, i.e. cannot be verified and are not routable. This is not optimal but is fine enough for our WVD sandbox. Go [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/prepare-a-non-routable-domain-for-directory-synchronization) for further details.  |

| See which **settings are assumed** when using **express config** | ...**wait a while**  | Hit **exit** to finalize setup.  |

## 3. Result
At the end of this setup your AAD should be synch'ed with your domain controller. To verify go to:
```
[Azure Portal] -> Azure Active Directory
```  
Your **AAD is in sync**: 
![AD in sync](AAD-Synced.PNG)  
and the **users are showing up in azure**:
