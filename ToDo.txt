Windows Virtual Desktop provides you access to a windows desktop where you need it (via https) on a large variety of devices. (PC, Mac, Tablet, Android, iPhone, linux thin clients)
The desktops are spun up in your subscription and controlled by you (vm size, capabilities, applications, work hours). Backend services (e.g. load balancing) are managed by Microsoft.

What are the requirements?
- Low brainer: A valid Azure subscription ;-)
- You need an Active Directory accessible from your Azure subscription. Why? Because the desktops will do a domain join. This is a current WVD requirement.
- Azure Active Directory that is sync'ed with the above Active directory. Why? Because the users who access WVD need to logon with AAD credentials + AD credentials.

Taxonomy:
Session Host: Is a vm in your subscription a user is connected to. It serves as a desktop in your WVD environment. It can be a Windows Client (e.g. Windows 10 OS) or Windows Server. A session host has agents on it that connect it to the WVD backend.
Host Pool: Is a group of Session Hosts that have identical configuration intented to serve the same group of users. 
Application Group: A WVD object that defines what the - applications, desktops, user assignment.
